# data-structs-and-algos

A collection of data structures and algorithms written in languages of my interest. Each language is placed in its own directory where file names will be the names of the data structure or algorithm. There is no detailed complexity analysis of a data structure's methods or algorithm. I am only focused on understanding how they are implemented.

# Goals

1. Better understand how a given data structure or algorithm is implemented

2. For some data structures (i.e. queues & stacks) and algorithms (i.e. binary search, BFS, & DFS) I would want the implementation to feel like "second nature". Coding a data structure or algorithm will feel as "natural" as coding a `for loop`
