# data-structs-and-algos

A collection of data structures and algorithms written in languages of my interest. Each language is placed in its own directory where file names will be the names of the data structure and algorithm. There is **NO** detailed complexity analysis of a data structure's methods or algorithm. I am only focused on understanding how they are implemented. Each language will have an accompany set of `unit tests` for the various data structures and algorithms.

# Goals

1. Better understand how a given data structure or algorithm is implemented

2. For some data structures (i.e. queues & stacks) and algorithms (i.e. binary search, BFS, & DFS) I would want the implementation to feel like "second nature". Coding these data structure or algorithm will feel as "natural" as coding a `for loop`

3. Testing code. Data structures and algorithms are an ideal "format" to practice testing code

4. Implementing style guides for programming languages and getting exposure to various conventions. The style guides for each langauage are as follow:

   - `Python`: PEP 8 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
   - `C`: GNU C Coding Standard (https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Writing-C.html)
     - GNU gives vague guidelines to certain aspects (i.e. file names) so Google's C++ style guide is used to supplement these areas (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
